# list_pagination_and_filtering-v1
 This is project 2 of Treehouse FSJS Techdegree - List Pagination and Filtering

 I am going for the grade of exceeding expectations

 Treehouse provided me with these starter project files:
 - HTML files:
    - index.html
    - Example files:
        - 44students.html
        - 66students.html
        - example-exceeds.html
        - example-meets.html
 - CSS files:
    - design.css
    - reset.css
 - JS file:
    - script.js (This is the one I'm editing)

To ex0ceed expectations Treehouse would like the following:
- NO SNIPPETS, PLUGINS OR LIBRARIES:
    - contains only plain "vanilla" JavaScript and doesn't rely on jQuery, some other library, or any code snippets or plugins.

- PROGRESSIVE ENCHANCEMENT & UNOBSTRUSIVE JAVASCRIPT
    - No inline JavaScript. All JavaScript is linked from an external file.
    - Use unobstrusive JavaScript to append markup for the pagination links. So none of the pagination link's markup is added into HTML.
    - Exceeds expectations by:
        - Use unobstrusive JavaScript to append HTML for a search bar

- PAGINATION LINKS:
    - Pagination Links are created. If there are 44 students, 5 links should be generated, if there's 66 students, 7 links should be generated. Etc.
    - Exceeds expectations by:
        - Pagination links display based on how many search results are returned. For example: if 10 or fewer results are returned, 0 or 1 pagination links are displayed. If 22 search results are returned, 3 pagination links are displayed.

- PAGING:
    - This first 10 students are shown when the page loads, and each pagination link displays the correct students.
    - Clicking on "1" in the pagination links should show students 1 to 10. Clicking "2" shows 11 to 20. Clicking "5" shows students 41 to 50, and so on.
    - Exceeds expectations by:
        - When a search yields 0 results, a message is displayed on the page, informing the user that no result have been found.

- CODE COMMENTS:
    - Code comments have been added explaining how the function works
